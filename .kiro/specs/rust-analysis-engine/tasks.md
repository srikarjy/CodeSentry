  - Compare memory usage and generate performance report
  - _Requirements: 6.7, 1.7_

- [ ] 4.3 HTTP API Polish (Thursday)

## Success Criteria for Month 1

- **HTTP API works:** `docker run your-image` → accessible on localhost:8080
- **Real analysis:** Correctly identifies complexity, security, and quality issues in actual codebases
- **Performance numbers:** Documented speed comparison vs existing tools
- **No crashes:** Handles syntax errors, large files, edge cases gracefully
- **Interview ready:** Can demo live analysis of any GitHub repository

## Daily Success Metrics

Each day, verify:
- Code compiles and all tests pass
- HTTP endpoint returns valid responses
- Performance doesn't regress from previous day
- Memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
