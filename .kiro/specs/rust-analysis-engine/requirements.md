# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Rust Analysis Engine is the core performance-critical component of CodeSentry that provides high-speed static code analysis across multiple programming languages. This engine will serve as the technical differentiator, delivering 10x faster analysis than traditional Python-based tools through efficient AST parsing, parallel processing, and optimized algorithms. The engine must be production-ready with comprehensive language support, extensible architecture, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using CodeSentry, I want my code to be analyzed quickly so that I can get immediate feedback without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code file is submitted for analysis THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 50ms per 1000 lines of code
2. WHEN analyzing multiple files concurrently THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times for up to 100 concurrent requests
3. WHEN processing large codebases THEN the system SHALL use no more than 100MB of memory per analysis session
4. IF analysis takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL return a timeout error with partial results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team, I want support for multiple programming languages so that our entire codebase can be analyzed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript code is submitted THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze ES6+ syntax including modules, classes, and async/await
2. WHEN TypeScript code is submitted THEN the system SHALL handle type annotations, interfaces, generics, and decorators
3. WHEN Python code is submitted THEN the system SHALL support Python 3.8+ syntax including type hints and async functions
4. WHEN Go code is submitted THEN the system SHALL parse packages, interfaces, goroutines, and channels
5. WHEN Rust code is submitted THEN the system SHALL handle ownership, lifetimes, traits, and macros
6. IF an unsupported language is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message with supported language list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want detailed analysis results including complexity metrics, security issues, and code smells so that I can make informed decisions about code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate cyclomatic complexity for each function
2. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL detect common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
3. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify code smells (long functions, deep nesting, duplicate code)
4. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL measure maintainability metrics (lines of code, cognitive complexity, coupling)
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return results in structured JSON format with severity levels
6. IF critical security issues are found THEN the system SHALL flag them with HIGH severity and detailed descriptions
7. WHEN analyzing code THEN system SHALL detect design patterns and anti-patterns using graph algorithms
8. WHEN comparing code THEN system SHALL calculate structural similarity using AST diff algorithms
9. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN system SHALL build call graphs and detect circular dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want the analysis engine to be extensible and configurable so that new analysis rules and languages can be added without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new analysis rules are defined THEN the system SHALL load them dynamically without restart
2. WHEN custom rule configurations are provided THEN the system SHALL apply team-specific thresholds and preferences
3. WHEN new language parsers are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them through a standardized plugin interface
4. WHEN rule violations are detected THEN the system SHALL support custom severity levels and categorization
5. IF rule configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and return specific error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and observability so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the analysis engine in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with correlation IDs
2. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance rather than crash
3. WHEN analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for latency, throughput, and resource usage
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them (parsing errors, timeout errors, resource errors)
5. IF memory usage exceeds 500MB THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and log a warning
6. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and analysis statistics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a software engineer integrating with the analysis engine, I want a clean API interface so that I can easily incorporate analysis capabilities into other services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is requested via API THEN the system SHALL accept JSON payloads with file content and configuration
2. WHEN analysis results are returned THEN the system SHALL provide consistent response schemas across all languages
3. WHEN batch analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL process multiple files efficiently and return aggregated results
4. WHEN streaming analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL support real-time analysis of code changes
5. IF API requests are malformed THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with detailed validation errors
6. WHEN API is under load THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and return HTTP 429 when exceeded
7. WHEN performance benchmarks are run THEN system SHALL consistently outperform tree-sitter by 3x and Semgrep by 5x on standard datasets
8. WHEN processing incremental changes THEN system SHALL analyze only modified functions/classes using dependency graphs
### Requ
irement 7

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the system to handle enterprise-scale workloads so that it can serve thousands of developers simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repositories with 1M+ lines THEN system SHALL partition work across multiple workers
2. WHEN system load exceeds 80% THEN system SHALL auto-scale horizontally
3. WHEN analyzing mono-repos THEN system SHALL cache intermediate results for 24 hours
4. WHEN distributed across regions THEN system SHALL maintain <200ms cross-region latency
5. WHEN processing concurrent requests THEN system SHALL handle 10,000+ simultaneous analysis jobs
6. IF worker nodes fail THEN system SHALL redistribute work automatically without data loss

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an SRE, I want comprehensive testing and reliability so that the system maintains 99.9% uptime in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN system SHALL include unit tests with >95% coverage
2. WHEN under load THEN system SHALL pass chaos engineering tests (random failures)
3. WHEN analyzing code THEN system SHALL validate against known-good benchmark datasets
4. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN system SHALL recover gracefully within 30 seconds
6. IF cascading failures are detected THEN system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns

### Requirement 9
